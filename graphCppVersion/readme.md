## [1 . Graph as input in the form of an adjacency matrix ](https://github.com/BibhabenduMukherjee/Graphs/blob/main/graphCppVersion/GraphInputAdjMatrix.cpp)
An adjacency matrix of a graph is a two-dimensional array of size n x n, where n is the number of nodes in the graph, with the property that a[ i ][ j ] = 1 if the edge (vᵢ, vⱼ) is in the set of edges, and a[ i ][ j ] = 0 if there is no such edge.
